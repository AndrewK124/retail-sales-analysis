# Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I crafted a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset using Excel. The goal of this analysis was to uncover insights from customer transactions across different demographics and product categories, and to present these findings through an interactive dashboard.

## What I've done

1. Initial Setup:
   - Downloaded and converted .csv to .xlsx
   - Created a duplicated of the original data into a "Working Sheet" for analysis

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
   - Reformatted "Price per Unit" and "Total Amount" from general format to Currency format
   - Added a new column: "Age Brackets", with the following categories:
       - 18-25
       - 26-34
       - 35-44
       - 45-54
       - 55+

3. Pivot Table & Visualizations:
   - Bar Chart: Average purchase value across age brackets
   - Pie Chart: Number of transactions by gender
   - Grouped Bar Chart: Total purchase value by gender and age group
   - Line Graph: Monthly total purchase trends throughout 2023 for each age group

 4. Dashboard Creation:
    - Assembled the pivot tables and visualzations into a clean, interactive dashboard.
    - Included slicers and a timeline for filtering

I encourage you to download the .xlsx and mess around with the data! Discover new insights, add more fields to the data, create more visualizations, or edit my dashboard to make it more visually appealing!
